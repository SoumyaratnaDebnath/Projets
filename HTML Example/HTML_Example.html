Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc.'s Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X-exclusive game engine. As of 2018, the engine had been extended to support more than 25 platforms. 

<br>The engine can be used to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences.The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming, such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering and construction.

<br>Several major versions of Unity have been released since its launch. The latest stable version, 2019.1.6, was released in June 2019.

Unity 2018 featured the Scriptable Render Pipeline for developers to create high-end graphics.This included the High-Definition Rendering Pipeline for console and PC experiences, and the Lightweight Rendering Pipeline for mobile, virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality.Unity 2018 also included machine learning tools, such as Imitation Learning, whereby games learn from real player habits, support for Magic Leap, and templates for new developers.

<br>Unity gives users the ability to create games and experiences in both 2D and 3D, and the engine offers a primary scripting API in C#, for both the Unity editor in the form of plugins, and games themselves, as well as drag and drop functionality. 

<br>Prior to C# being the primary programming language used for the engine, it previously supported Boo, which was removed with the release of Unity 5, and a version of JavaScript called UnityScript, which was deprecated in August 2017, after the release of Unity 2017.1, in favor of C#.

It has much better cross-platform integration. It enables you to deploy your game across all major mobile, VR, desktop, console, and TV platforms plus the Web. The supported platforms include Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Tizen, PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One, PlayStation Mobile, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, tvOS, Android Tv, and Samsung Smart TV. Native support is available for major VR platforms including Oculus Rift, Gear VR, Playstation VR, Microsoft HoloLens and Steam VR/Vive.
Unity is the best fit for creating mobile games as, overall, it’s easier to build them with this engine. In general, it’s more logical and convenient to develop simple games with Unity.
It is better and faster for developing mobile VR, e.g. for Cardboard.
It has a huge asset store and many plugins, which gives you more access to diverse game monetization infrastructure like mobile ad networks, ad videos, etc.
The engine architecture is simpler to understand and work with, the launch process is less complicated.
